## Oscilloscopes for Power Analysis
An oscilloscope is essential for power analysis, as it allows you to capture the voltage and current waveform fluctuations of the RFID tag's power consumption. It’s used to observe any variations in power that occur during cryptographic operations or data exchanges, which might reveal weaknesses in the tag's security.

## Power Analyzers for RFID/NFC Power Analysis
A power analyzer is a specialized instrument designed to measure power consumption in devices, such as RFID tags. It can measure and log various parameters like voltage, current, and power draw over time, which are useful for detecting subtle variations during RFID communications.

## Current Probes for Oscilloscopes
A current probe (also called a differential current probe) is an instrument that can measure the current flowing through the RFID tag during its operation. This is a critical tool for power analysis attacks, as it allows you to observe the current consumption at a very granular level, helping to detect patterns associated with cryptographic operations or other internal processes.

## Signal Conditioning Devices
Power signals may contain noise or other irrelevant data. In such cases, signal conditioning equipment such as filters, amplifiers, or attenuators can help isolate the power consumption data you need to analyze.
